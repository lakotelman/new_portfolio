- Your desk set up is important. It should be a place you enjoy being and are comfortable in.
- Invest in stretchy pants that aren’t sweats. Be dressed for work, but prioritize comfort.
- Read your team’s documentation before asking someone for help. It feels smart when you find it, and feels dumb when someone finds it for you.
- Sometimes a teams call is just faster than trying to explain your problem to a colleague in screenshots and text.
- Commit to regular movement, better if it’s outside.
- Take breaks from your screen. Those blue light glasses are cute, but nothing works better than just standing up and looking at something else.
- If you’re crying about a problem, it’s time for a break.
- Your dog, Rosa, will be very popular when she comes on screen.
- People can see you when you get distracted by the literal squirrels playing outside your window.
